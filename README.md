Developed a personal assistant application with speech recognition capabilities, enabling seamless interaction with the assistant through voice commands, with the assistant speaking back when a task has been completed. Implemented an extensive range of voice-activated commands, so the assistant can open applications, set timers, play and pause music on iTunes, download music from youtube, performing Google searches, initiating conversations with Chat GPT, open school work, among other things to enhance productivity and convenience. OpenAI API used to be able to have a conversation with chat GPT. Also, many libraries used such as speech recognition and pytube.

The personalassistant.py file has the main commands that include function for the assistant to speak back and loop to wait for one of the many commands it is capable of. The playmusic.py file is called when the user wants to listen to music and it navigates through iTunes in order to play or pause music. The download.py file is capable of downloading music from youtube if the user would like to.
